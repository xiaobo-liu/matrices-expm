`matrices-expm` - Collection of matrices for testing the matrix exponential.
==========

About
-----

`matrices-expm` is a collection of MATLAB functions that generate the selected matrices for testing the matrix exponential. All matrices are square and have a fixed size, ranging from 2-by-2 to 20-by-20. Most of the matrices are taken from the matrix exponential literature. 
The matrices are used in

Anymatrix Integration
-----

This collection is ready to include as a group in the Anymatrix for which the name `expm` should be used.
MATLAB 2020b or newer is required for the use of Anymatrix.
